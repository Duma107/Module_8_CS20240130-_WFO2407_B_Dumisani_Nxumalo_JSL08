Singleton Pattern for Bank Branch Management
This project demonstrates the implementation of the Singleton Design Pattern in JavaScript to manage a bank branch's information. By ensuring that only one instance of the BankBranch class is created, this pattern provides a global point of access to the branch's information, making it easier to manage and update.

Introduction
In this project, we use the Singleton Design Pattern to manage a bank's branch information. The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of the BankBranch class exists at any time, providing a consistent and centralized way to store and update the bank branch's details. This approach can be beneficial for managing application-wide configurations or shared resources.

Technologies
JavaScript (ES6)
Features
Ensures only a single instance of the bank branch is created.
Provides methods to access and update branch information.
Demonstrates the basic principles of the Singleton pattern in JavaScript.
Usage
Create an instance of the BankBranch class by passing an object containing the bank branch's details (e.g., name, address, manager).
Attempt to create a second instance, but the Singleton pattern ensures that only the first instance is used.
Retrieve and update the branch information from any reference to the BankBranch instance.
When attempting to create multiple instances of the BankBranch class, the Singleton pattern ensures that all references point to the same object, keeping the branch information consistent across your application.

Code Structure
1. Singleton Instance
A variable is used to store the single instance of the BankBranch class. This ensures that only one instance exists, and all subsequent requests return the same object.

2. BankBranch Class
Constructor: Initializes branch information only if no instance exists. If an instance already exists, the constructor returns the existing one.
getBranchInfo: Retrieves the stored branch information.
updateBranchInfo: Allows updating branch details by merging new information with the existing data.
3. Usage
The Singleton pattern is implemented in such a way that any attempt to create a new instance will always return the same original instance, ensuring that the branch information is consistent.
